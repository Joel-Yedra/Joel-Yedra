## Hey I´m Joel

- 🌟 About me:

  I am a Mechatronics engineer in my final semester, with experience in programming languages such as C, C++, and Python, as well as microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32. I have also created 3D models of individual pieces and designed pneumatic circuits for automated systems. I stand out for my ability to be proactive, work effectively in a team, collaborate in multidisciplinary environments, and be committed to continuous learning and ongoing improvement to increase my knowledge.
